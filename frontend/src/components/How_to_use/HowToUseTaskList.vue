This page explains how to use the task list.
This task list is linked to the Critical Equipment List, which is MECHPHAISTOS's main system.
This task list allows you to keep track of the implementation status of the maintenance tasks and the future schedule.

By optimizing the implementation status, you can reduce over-maintenance and optimize repair costs.
*From a management perspective, reducing repair costs is a requirement these days, but this is ultimately optimization.


Fill in the task names and tasks in the list below and set the maintenance cycle to understand future task schedules and repair budgets.

First, enter the task name and the associated BOMCode.

You may be wondering what BOMcode is, but there are many parts generated for one task. There is a limit to expressing them in a table format like this, so they are linked by BOMCode like this.

For example, task-001 will have part001, part002, part003, and these are managed as BOMList.

Clicking on the BomCode will display it in the next modal, so you can add or delete it here.

This BomCode is also managed in a separate table by sparePartsList, so you can edit it here.

Here you can check the delay status of maintenance tasks and understand the costs associated with them.
You can also simulate maintenance costs for this year, next year, and up to 10 years into the future by filling in the check boxes.

The GAP of the maintenance costs incurred is displayed in the Benefit table.
As we have said many times before, from a management perspective, 
reducing repair costs is a welcome thing, but please be aware that there are times when such repairs are unavoidable when considering the soundness of the facilities.
