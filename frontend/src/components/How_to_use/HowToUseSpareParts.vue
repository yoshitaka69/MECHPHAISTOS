Here we will explain about the spare parts list.
This spare parts list is strongly linked to the TaskList rather than the Critical Equipment List.

Also, in terms of managing appropriate repair costs, it is the first measure that comes up in spare parts management.

There are some confusing points, so please be careful.
Spare parts are categorized into several categories, so you need to learn and understand what kind of spare parts they are.
Also, it is rare to know spare parts individually, and they will probably be specified as a set.
In such cases, a set name called BOM is used.
(BOM = partA, partB, partC...)

spareParts does not manage the entry and exit of parts in a separate form. (It is possible to implement it in the system, but I was wondering if it was worth the trouble. If you would like it implemented, please contact us.)
However, the entry and exit of parts is managed by updating the sparePartsList through communication with the back-end server.

Based on the following inventory management, lead time, and the implementation period of the taskList, an alert is issued when parts need to be purchased.
Even if factories are scattered in various locations, it is possible to know what parts are needed for each factory.
