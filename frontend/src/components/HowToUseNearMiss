Here I will explain about near misses.
I myself once thought deeply about confusing maintenance with near misses.
However, these combinations are inseparably related and have many positive aspects for each other, so at MECHPHAISTOS we consider near misses to be part of the maintenance domain.

A major feature of these near misses is that they allow us to compare safety indexes at a global level with the safety indexes of each company.
In addition, by collecting near miss data, we can determine the level of danger that is approaching and predict and avoid it in advance.
