This page will show you how to use the critical equipment list. 
First, go to the critical equipment page from the imput page or side bar.


There are several ways to imput.

1. Download the format Excel from the download page in the upper right and upload it.

2. Copy and paste or fill in the table directly.

2. Copy and paste or fill in the table directly.


This table is very similar to Excel, so you can copy and paste and write directly into the cells.
Please note that you cannot write in cells that are light grey because functions or specific values ​​will be filled in automatically.

*If you have any better ideas for using these cells, please get in touch.

There are a few things worth mentioning. These are the features of MECHPHAISTOS.

1. You can visualize the maintenance status and potential risks of specific equipment.

Now, as shown in the figure on the right, the importance of each piece of equipment is determined from its equipment maintenance status and trouble history. The importance is determined from the possibility of failure, frequency of occurrence, and sustainability, and the impact on production equipment is determined as the importance.

For example, as shown below

* Explanation of colors

However, by taking measures here, we have set it up so that the risk can be reduced.

In the future, we would like to capture electrical signals from each measuring device, but in fact, the opinion from the field side is that the initial cost is very high, and there are no clean places or equipment at the field. And it is clear that the equipment status cannot be measured by such management methods alone (separate documents).

Therefore, MECHPHAISTOS does not use the above system, which is generally mainstream, but determines the equipment status from the maintenance history.
